/**
 * The Connection class handles queues for individual players, one connection per player.
 * Connections are identified by their names (m_name).  This should accommodate changing IPs
 * in the face of modem disconnects, NAT irregularities, etc.
 * Messages can be guaranteed or non-guaranteed, sequenced or not.
 *
 *
 * So how this works is this:
 * The connection contains the incoming and outgoing commands to and from the player this
 * connection object represents.  The incoming packets are separated into the different frames
 * of execution.  This is done for efficiency reasons since we will be keeping track of commands
 * that are to be executed on many different frames, and they will need to be retrieved by the
 * connection manager on a per-frame basis.  We don't really care what frame the outgoing
 * commands are executed on as they all need to be sent out right away to ensure that the commands
 * get to their destination in time.
